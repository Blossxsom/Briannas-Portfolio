  <h2>Congresional App Challenge Project</h2>
  <h3>09/23/24-10/24/24</h3>
  <p>The Congressional App Challenge, created by the U.S. House of Representatives, promotes student innovation in computer science and STEM. In this project,
  students were directed to create an app to address a social issue. I developed a job-finding app specifically for teenagers who are looking to learn more about 
  financial matters and employment. </p>
